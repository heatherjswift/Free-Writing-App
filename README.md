## Future Development
*	Different length timers 5, 10, 15
*	Recommended playlists based on types of writing, mysteries, fantasy, sci-fi, post-apocalyptic, school project
*	Separate page linked in nav with all past entries that tells you the prompt you had at the time of writing, how long you wrote for that session, word count.
*	When you complete a prompt and save the app will give you a compliment and cheer you on
*	If you keep hitting refresh it asks you if you’re still stuck and refers you to the inspiration board
*	To monetize if they want the option to save it asks them to watch a short ad
*	Some kind of xp gain system with achievements for using the app.
*	Create user accounts
*	Top stories
*	Users can vote on stories
